            <p>Hey I'm Adam Cole. I am finishing up my time at the App Academy full stack software engineering bootcamp. I will be job hunting and looking for experience in a few weeks. I am interested in front end and backend. I have a background in troubleshooting both vehicles and air conditioners as well as a background in music. I am excited to see the opportunities my change of career will bring me and how I can help those around me with the things I will someday create. This project is the reason I decided to give coding a real try in the first place and thanks to bootcamp and weeks of hardwork I was finally able to make it a reality.</p>
